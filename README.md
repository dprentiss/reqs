Requirements Engineerinng Query System
====

Reqs is a proof-of-concept application that demonstrates the ability of graph 
based databases to model and query complex entity-relationship concepts. In this
case, an embedded database based on Neo4j is used to represent Stakeholders,
Concerns, and Viewpoints as described in IEEE 1471 standard describing the
architecture of a software-intensive system. 
Although the application at present is particular to architecture desrition, it is being deloped with the the full-lifecycle of general systems in mind.

The challenge presented by this task is to capture and effectively traverse the 
many to many relationships between the three entities. For this initial version 
of Reqs, the user is presented with a graph-based visual representation of the 
Stakeholders, Concerns, and Viewpoints in a hypothetical architecture 
description. The user can graphically select one or more entities and the system 
responds by highlighting the entities that are related to it.  





``` java
 public Iterable<Relationship> getRelationships() {
        TraversalDescription traversal = Traversal.description()
            .breadthFirst()
            .evaluator(new Evaluator() {
                @Override
                public Evaluation evaluate(final Path path) {
                    if (path.length() == 0) {
                        return Evaluation.EXCLUDE_AND_CONTINUE;
                    }
                    boolean isOutgoingIS_MEMBER = (
                        path.lastRelationship().getEndNode() == 
                        path.endNode() &&
                        (path.lastRelationship()
                        .isType(ReqsDb.RelTypes.IS_MEMBER)));
                    boolean isRelTypeUnique = true;
                    Iterator<Relationship> i = 
                path.reverseRelationships().iterator();
                    i.next();
                    while (i.hasNext()) {
                        if (i.next().isType(path.lastRelationship()
                                .getType())) {
                            isRelTypeUnique = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    boolean included = isOutgoingIS_MEMBER || isRelTypeUnique;
                    boolean continued = included;
                    return Evaluation.of(included, continued);
                }
            });
```
